Memories is WordPress plugin that will help you rediscover the post(s) you published today in history (Inspired by [Timehop](http://timehop.com)). 

== Description ==

Memories will be super fun for those who have blogged in years. Install and activate Memories, Memories then will send you post(s) that you have published today in the history every morning. Assuming you have blogged since 2010 and today is August 11th, 2014, Memories will send you an email (as set on Dashboard > Settings > Email Address) containing posts that you have published on:
